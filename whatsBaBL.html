                        <h1 id="WB1" class="uk-text-primary">What's BaBL?</h1>
                        <p>
                            BaBL is a multi-user videoconferencing application able to provide real-time caption and other features
                            related to speech recognition as instant translation and transcription storage using HTML5 APIs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            BaBL requires no installation nor plugins. All the required components are built-in in the browser or are
                            accessed through the Internet. You will need the latest Google Chrome browser in order to enjoy all the
                            features included in BaBL because Chrome is the only browser that has implemented the Web Speech API
                            nowadays, used for speech recognition. The rest of the browser vendors are expected to implement this
                            HTML5 API soon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The application was developed by Luis Villaseñor Muñoz during the Fall 2013 and the Spring 2014 semesters
                            at Illinois Institute of Technology as part of his course work. The application's development was
                            supervised since its beginning by Professor Carol Davids.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The application was presented in public on April 30, 2014, at the Real-Time Communications Roundtable
                            event hosted by the RTC Research Lab.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            BaBL has been developed using free resources and technologies that are still under development. However,
                            we think the result is satisfactory. Technology is awesome.
                        </p>

                        <h1 id="WB2" class="uk-text-primary">Multiconference</h1>
                        <p>
                            Using the WebRTC web API, BaBL is able to provide audio and video conferencing. There can be multiple
                            conferences going on at the same time and each of these conferences can have multiple users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When possible, the call is established using peer-to-peer connections between users, improving
                            performance, security and privacy compared to centralized conference services.
                        </p>

                        <h1 id="WB3" class="uk-text-primary">Real-time captioning</h1>
                        <p>
                            Thanks to the HTML5's Web Speech API we are able to convert the local user's speech into text. Once we
                            have the text, we use the WebRTC datachannel to transmit the speech transcription to the remote users
                            that are requesting real-time captioning.
                        </p>

                        <h1 id="WB4" class="uk-text-primary">Transcription storage</h1>
                        <p>
                            Another feature included in BaBL consists in storing locally the transcribed conversation that is taking
                            place in the room, so the user can read it later. The application will collect the speech transcription
                            of every user present in the room (including ourselves) and will store them using IndexedDB, another
                            HTML5 API.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This feature can be turned on or off by operating the transcription storage switch. All the stored
                            transcriptions can be browsed clicking the "Browse stored transcriptions" link. These transcriptions
                            include the user, the time and the room in which these transcriptions were taken.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some advantages of storing transcribed conversations instead of the conference's audio or video are that
                            the transcribed conversations are just text, much lighter than audio or video and easier to search and
                            browse.
                        </p>

                        <h1 id="WB5" class="uk-text-primary">Instant translation</h1>
                        <p>
                            If the users speak different languages, BaBL is able to provide translated subtitles. The original
                            transcribed speech will be send to a translation service taking into consideration both the original
                            language and the desired language. The translation service chosen is Microsoft Translator.
                        </p>

                        <h1 id="WB6" class="uk-text-primary">Spoken subtitles</h1>
                        <p>
                            Do you imagine having a conversation with someone who speaks in other language and listening to him in
                            your own language? You can do it with BaBL! Now that we have the translated text we can use one of the
                            speech synthesis engines of the Web Speech API to read them aloud.
                        </p>
